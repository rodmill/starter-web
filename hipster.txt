Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? You enjoyed that. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Besides, you look good in a dress. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Talk about going nowhere fast. This should be interesting. How long can two people talk about nothing? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once.
